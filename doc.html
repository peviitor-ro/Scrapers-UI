              Web scraping is one of the most efficient and useful ways to
              extract data from a website, especially in 2023!
            </h3>
            <p>
              Some websites can contain a very large amount of invaluable data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stock prices, product details, sports stats, company contacts, you
              name it.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wanted to access this information, you‚Äôd either have to use
              whatever format the website uses or copy-paste the information
              manually into a new document. Here‚Äôs where web scraping can help.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Web Scraping?</h2>
            <p>
              Web scraping refers to the
              <strong>extraction of data from a website.</strong> This
              information is collected and then exported into a format that is
              more useful for the user. Be it a spreadsheet or an API.
            </p>

              <img

                alt="web-scraping"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              Although web scraping can be done manually, in most cases,
              automated tools are preferred when scraping web data as they can
              be less costly and work at a faster rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              But in most cases, web scraping is not a simple task. Websites
              come in many shapes and forms, as a result, web scrapers vary in
              functionality and features.

                Please note that you may encounter captchas when attempting to
                scrape some websites, so we suggest reading several guides on
                how to avoid & bypass captchas before scraping a website:

            <h2>Is web scraping legal?</h2>
            <p>
              In short, the action of web scraping isn't illegal. However, some
              rules need to be followed. Web scraping becomes illegal when non
              publicly available data becomes extracted.
            </p>
            <p>
              This comes as no surprise given the growth of web scraping and
              many recent legal cases related to web scraping.

              So, how do web scrapers work? Automated web scrapers work in a
              rather simple but also complex way. After all, websites are built
              for humans to understand, not machines.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, the web scraper will be given one or more URLs to load
              before scraping. The scraper then loads the entire HTML code for
              the page in question. More advanced scrapers will render the
              entire website, including CSS and Javascript elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then the scraper will either extract all the data on the page or
              specific data selected by the user before the project is run.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally, the user will go through the process of selecting the
              specific data they want from the page. For example, you might want
              to scrape an Amazon product page for prices and models but are not
              necessarily interested in product reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, the web scraper will output all the data that has been
              collected into a format that is more useful to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most web scrapers will output data to a CSV or Excel spreadsheet,
              while more advanced scrapers will support other formats such as
              JSON which can be used for an API.
            </p>

            <h2>What Kind of Web Scrapers are There?</h2>
            <p>
              Web scrapers can drastically differ from each other on a
              case-by-case basis.
            </p>
            <div>
              <img
                src="./images/doc/webscraping/types-of-web-scrapers.jpeg"

              />
            </div>
            <ul>
              <p>
                For simplicity‚Äôs sake, we will break down some of these aspects
                into <strong>4 categories.</strong> Of course, there are more
                intricacies at play when comparing web scrapers.
              </p>
              <li>self-built or pre-built</li>
              <li>browser extension vs software</li>
              <li>User interface</li>
              <li>Cloud vs Local</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Self-built or Pre-built</h3>
            <p>
              Just like how anyone can build a website, anyone
              <a
                href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/making-web-crawlers-scrapy-python"
                target="_blank"
                >can build their own web scraper.
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the tools available to build your own web scraper still
              require some advanced programming knowledge. The scope of this
              knowledge also increases with the number of features you‚Äôd like
              your scraper to have.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, there are numerous pre-built web scrapers that
              you can download and run right away. Some of these will also have
              advanced options added such as scrape scheduling, JSON and Google
              Sheets exports and more.
            </p>
            <h3>Browser extension vs Software</h3>
            <p>
              In general terms, web scrapers come in two forms: browser
              extensions or computer software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Browser extensions are app-like programs that can be added to your
              browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox. Some popular browser
              extensions include themes, ad blockers, messaging extensions and
              more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web scraping extensions have the benefit of being simpler to run
              and being integrated right into your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, these extensions are usually limited by living in your
              browser. Meaning that any advanced features that would have to
              occur outside of the browser would be impossible to implement. For
              example, IP Rotations would not be possible in this kind of
              extension.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, you will have actual web scraping software that
              can be downloaded and installed on your computer. While these are
              a bit less convenient than browser extensions, they make up for it
              in advanced features that are not limited by what your browser can
              and cannot do.
            </p>

            <h3>User Interface</h3>
            <p>
              The user interface between web scrapers can vary quite extremely.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, some web scraping tools will run with a minimal UI
              and a command line. Some users might find this unintuitive or
              confusing.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, some web scrapers will have a full-fledged UI
              where the website is fully rendered for the user to just click on
              the data they want to scrape. These web scrapers are usually
              easier to work with for most people with limited technical
              knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some scrapers will go as far as integrating help tips and
              suggestions through their UI to make sure the user understands
              each feature that the software offers.
            </p>
            <h3>Cloud vs Local</h3>
            <p>From where does your web scraper actually do its job?</p>
            <p>
              Local web scrapers will run on your computer using its resources
              and internet connection. This means that if your web scraper has a
              high usage of CPU or RAM, your computer might become quite slow
              while your scrape runs. With long scraping tasks, this could put
              your computer out of commission for hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, if your scraper is set to run on a large number of
              URLs (such as product pages), it can have an impact on your ISP‚Äôs
              data caps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cloud-based web scrapers run on an off-site server which is
              usually provided by the company that developed the scraper itself.
              This means that your computer‚Äôs resources are freed up while your
              scraper runs and gathers data. You can then work on other tasks
              and be notified later once your scrape is ready to be exported.
            </p>
            <p>
              This also allows for very easy integration of advanced features
              such as IP rotation, which can prevent your scraper from getting
              blocked from major websites due to their scraping activity.

            <h2>What are Web Scrapers Used For?</h2>
            <p>
              By this point, you can probably think of several different ways in
              which
              <a

                target="_blank"
                >web scrapers can be used.</a
              >
              We‚Äôve put some of the most common ones below (plus a few unique
              ones).
            </p>
            <h3>Real Estate Listing Scraping</h3>
            <p>
              Many real estate agents use web scraping to populate their
              database of available properties for sale or for rent.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a real estate agency will scrape MLS listings to
              build an API that directly populates this information onto their
              website. This way, they get to act as the agent for the property
              when someone finds this listing on their site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most listings that you will find on a Real Estate website are
              automatically generated by an API.
            </p>
            <h3>Industry Statistics and Insights</h3>
            <p>
              Many companies use web scraping to build massive databases and
              draw industry-specific insights from these. These companies can
              then sell access to these insights to companies in said
              industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a company might scrape and analyze tons of data about
              oil prices, exports and imports in order to sell their insights to
              oil companies across the world.
            </p>
            <h3>Comparison Shopping Sites</h3>
            <p>
              Some several websites and applications can help you to easily
              compare pricing between several retailers for the same product.
            </p>
            <p>
              One way that these websites work is by using web scrapers to
              scrape product data and pricing from each retailer daily. This
              way, they can provide their users with the comparison data they
              need.
            </p>
            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <p>
              One incredibly popular use of web scraping is lead generation.
              This use is so popular in fact, that we have written an entire
              guide on using web scraping for lead generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, web scraping is used by many companies to collect
              contact information about potential customers or clients. This is
              incredibly common in the business-to-business space, where
              potential customers will post their business information publicly
              online.
